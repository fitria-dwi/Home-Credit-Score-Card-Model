# Home Credit Score Card Model

_Created by Fitria Dwi Wulandari â€“ July, 2022_

### **Project Background**
Many individuals struggle to obtain loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Home Credit aims to enhance financial inclusion for the unbanked population by offering a positive and secure borrowing experience. To ensure this underserved group has access to loans, Home Credit leverages alternative data to assess clients' repayment abilities.

### **Objectives**
This project aims to reduce the rejection of creditworthy clients by:
* Identifying characteristics of clients who face difficulties in repaying loans.
* Developing a predictive model to accurately assess clients' repayment abilities.

### **Methodology**
#### <code style="color : darkpurple">Data Preparation</code>
* **Source**: Data obtained from the Home Credit Data Scientist Virtual Internship Program at Rakamin Academy.
* **Actions**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis to ensure high-quality inputs for the model.

#### <code style="color : darkpurple">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</code>
* **Purpose**: To discover patterns, spot anomalies, and gain a deeper understanding of the data's characteristics.
* **Techniques**: Visualization, summary statistics, and correlation analysis to identify significant features.

#### <code style="color : darkpurple">Machine Learning</code>
* **Goal**: Build models to predict clients' repayment capabilities.
* **Approach**: 6 algorithms were evaluated to determine the best prediction model.

#### <code style="color : darkpurple">Tools</code>
* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### **Results**
The analysis revealed that the Random Forest model, with an accuracy of 99%, was the most effective in predicting clients' repayment capabilities.  This model enables precise and reliable decision-making, ensuring that creditworthy clients are approved and provided with suitable loan terms, ultimately empowering them for successful repayment and financial stability.

### **Future Work**
* **Model Improvement**: Explore more advanced machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.
* **Broader Application**: Extend the analysis to other aspects of loan approval, such as loan terms and customer segmentation, to further enhance the approval process.
